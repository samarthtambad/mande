# Tech Roadmap

We have split the roadmap into a series of incremental stages.

## Stage 1	
1. Create a new blockchain with default configurations - **Done**
2. Add our MAND and CRED tokens to the blockchain - **Done**		
3. Make CRED the staking token - **Done**	
4. Get a dev chain up and running with 1 validator node and some full nodes - **Done**
5. Ability to convert a full node into a validator node by staking 
6. Make CRED non transferrable
				
## Stage 2	
1. Integrate smart contract functionality to our chain using CosmWasm	
2. Test it out by deploying a test toy smart contract			
3. Identify and integrate tools to perform logging and analytics for tracking performance and debugging issues
4. Identify and integrate tools to perform simulations for performance, scalability, etc
				
## Stage 3	
1. Create separate address (voting address) for holding CRED (voting module)
2. Modify the Tendermint proof of stake consensus to be based on the amount of CRED in the voting addresses
3. Add backend apis for handling voting
4. Design and create the front-end application for the CRED voting process
5. Add functionality for distributiion of validator rewards (in MAND)
				
## Stage 4
1. Build Dapps for various usecases
2. Launch Dapps on the dev chain			
3. Software upgrade process for when the chain is live	
4. Identify invariants and handling crisis situations
5. Performance testing
				
## Stage 5
1. Launch the test chain
2. Onboard Dapps onto test chain

## Stage 6
1. Launch main chain
